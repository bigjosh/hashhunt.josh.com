<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Q: How do I get my prize if I win?</b><br>
A: The Hash Hunt webpage will display a message with a redemption code that will use to claim your prize. The redemption code
is in standard WIF (Bitcoin Wallet Import Format) so can be easily imported into any bitcoin wallet system you choose to use.
</p>

<p><B>Q: Is there any cost to play?</b><br>
A: No, there is no charge to play Hash Hunt at this time.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Are there any restrictions on how winnings can be used?</b><br>
A: No. Once you import your winnings into your bitcoin wallet you can use them like any other bitcoins.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Does playing Hash Hunt use up a lot of data?</b></br>
A: No. Hash Hunt only uses a small amount of data when (1) when you load the page, (2) when a new round starts, (3) when
you submit a winning pattern to the Hash Hunt server. Playing Hash Hunt for several hours uses less data than loading the
New York Time homepage once.
</p>


<p><b>Q: Is there a time limit to claim my bitcoins if I win?</b><br>
A: No. You can take as long as you want to import your winnings into your wallet. The only ways you can forfeit your winnings
are if (1) you lose your redemption code, or (2) you share your redemption code with someone and they use it to claim your bitcoins
before you do. It is strongly recommend that you immediately record your redemption code in a safe place and do not share
it with anyone.
</p>

<p><b>Q: How do I solve the puzzle?</b><br>
A: Find the pattern of selected numbers that makes all of the reels land on hashes.
</p>

<p><b>Q: How many tries do I get to find the correct pattern?</b><br>
A: You can keep trying different patterns until the round ends, which usually takes several minutes.
</p>


<p><b>Q: Do I have to start over again from scratch when the current round ends?</b><br>
A: Yes, all patterns reset at the beginning of each new round. Patterns also reset anytime you reload the Hash Hunt webpage.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Is this real?</b><br>
A: This is real. If you are the first to get all 20 hashes in a given round then you will win 5 bitcoin.

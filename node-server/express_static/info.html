  <li>Click numbers to toggle them on and off.</li>

  <li>The first to find all the hashes in each round wins a bitcoin.</li>
  <li>A new round begins automatically after each win.</li>
  <li>A new puzzle is generated at the start of each round or any time the Hash Hunt page is reloaded.</li>
</ul>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Q: How do I get my prize if I win?</b><br>
    A: If you solve the puzzle, you will automatically be redirected to a webpage that will display a prize redemption code
    that you will use to claim your prize. This redemption code is in standard WIF (Bitcoin Wallet Import Format) and so can be easily
    imported into any bitcoin wallet system you choose to use.
</p>

<p><B>Q: Is there any cost to play?</b><br>
    A: No, there is no charge to play Hash Hunt at this time.
</p>

<p><B>Q: How long does each round last?</b><br>
    A: Each round lasts until a puzzle solution is found. This can take a few seconds, or many minutes. You will get a notification
    when the current round ends and will automatically get a new puzzle to solve for the next round.
</p>


<p><B>Q: What are "FREE" hashes?</b><br>
    A: "FREE" hashes are added from time to time to make the puzzles easier to solve and quicken the pace of the rounds. If you see
    a "FREE" hash on a wheel, then you dop not need to solve that wheel to win the puzzle.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Are there any restrictions on how winnings can be used?</b><br>
    A: No. Once you import your winnings into the bitcoin wallet of your choice you can use them like any other bitcoins.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Does playing Hash Hunt use up a lot of data?</b></br>
    A: No. Hash Hunt only uses a small amount of data when (1) when you load the page, (2) when a new round starts, (3) when
    you submit a winning pattern to the Hash Hunt server. Playing Hash Hunt for several hours uses less data than loading the
    New York Times homepage once - and is far more productive.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Is there a time limit to claim my prize?</b><br>
    A: No. You can take as long as you want to import your winnings into your wallet. The only ways you can forfeit your winnings
    are if (1) you lose your redemption code, or (2) you share your redemption code with someone and they use it to claim your prize
    before you do. It is strongly recommend that you immediately record your redemption code in a safe place and do not share
    it with anyone.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Is there a limit to how often I can win a prize?</b><br>
    A: No. First to solve the puzzle in each round always wins the prize. There are no restrictions on how often or how many times you can win.
</p>

<p><b>Q: How do I solve the puzzle?</b><br>
    A: Find the pattern of selected numbers that makes all of the wheels land on hashes.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Are there any partial paylines?</b><br>
    A: Possibly coming soon, but for now Hash Hunt only pays jackpots.
</p>

<p><b>Q: It says that I solved the puzzle, but not all of the wheels are hashes. Is this a bug?</b><br>
    A: There are rare cases when you can come very close to getting all of the hashes and the system will
    give you the benefit of the doubt and consider the puzzle solved even though there still is one wheel that
    is not a hash. These are real wins and you will receive the prize (assuming you are the first in that round).
</p>

<p><b>Q: I solved the puzzle but now it turns out that I am not the winner and do not get a prize?</b><br>
    A: To receive a prize, you must be the *first* to submit a solution in a given round. Rarely, two solutions will be
    found at almost the same time (usually seconds apart) and it can take up to an hour to determine which is the true winner.
    When you solve a puzzle, you will automatically be taken to a link where you can check the status of the round to see
    if your solution was received by the network first.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Can I play Hash Hunt offline (like on an airplane or in a subway)?</b><br>
    A: You can play anywhere, but to win a prize you must be the first to submit your solution to the network- which
    requires a network connection. Additionally you need a network connection to find out when a new round has started so you
    do not waste time solving an old puzzle. So while it is possible to practice offline, you will be very sad if you accidentally
    solve the puzzle but can not claim the prize because you can not submit your solution!
</p>

<p><b>Q: How many tries do I get to find the correct pattern?</b><br>
    A: You can keep trying different patterns until the round ends, which usually takes several minutes.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Do I have to start over again from scratch when the current round ends?</b><br>
    A: Yes, all puzzles reset at the beginning of each new round. Puzzles also reset anytime you reload the Hash Hunt webpage.
</p>

<p><b>Q: I got all hashes to come up on the wheels, but then got the message "Solution rejected by server". What gives?</b><br>
    A: You tried to cheat and it did not work. The server checks to make sure that the selected numbers actually correspond to the
    values on the wheels before validating a win, so the only person you are cheating is yourself.
</p>

<p><b>Q: I am a genius and I will write a little script to just try every combination of numbers until I win.</b><br>
    A: Good luck, but maybe do the math first. It is extremely unlikely that your script will be able to find a solution before the
    end of the round by blindly trying combinations. If you lost your keys [sic], would you start blindly checking
    each and every cubic inch of the universe until you found them? Where would you start? The center, I assume?
</p>

<p><b>Q: Is this real?</b><br>
    A: This is real. If you are the first to get all of the hashes and submit your solution to the network in a given round then
    you will win a shinny new bitcoin.
</p>

<p><b>Q: I have a question.</b><br>
    A: If you have read the above FAQ carefully and still have a question, you can contact me <a href="http://josh.com/contact.html">here</a>.
    Please note that I can not give advice on winning strategies - you will have to figure it out for yourself!

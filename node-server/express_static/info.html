<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Q: How do I get my prize if I win?</b><br>
    A: If you solve the puzzle, you will automatically be redirected to a webpage that will display a prize redemption code
    that will use to claim your prize. This redemption code is in standard WIF (Bitcoin Wallet Import Format) and so can be easily
    imported into any bitcoin wallet system you choose to use.
</p>

<p><B>Q: Is there any cost to play?</b><br>
    A: No, there is no charge to play Hash Hunt at this time.
</p>

<p><B>Q: How long does each round last?</b><br>
    A: Each round lasts until a puzzle solution is found. This can take a few seconds, or many minutes. You will get a notification
    when the current round ends and will automatically get a new puzzle to solve for the next round.
</p>


<p><B>Q: What are "FREE" hashes?</b><br>
    A: A "FREE" hash is a hash that you get for free. You can ignore "FREE" hash wheels when solving the puzzle.
    You only need to solve all of the non-"FREE" wheels to win. "FREE" hashes are added from time to time to make
    the puzzles easier to solve and quicken the pace of the rounds.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Are there any restrictions on how winnings can be used?</b><br>
    A: No. Once you import your winnings into the bitcoin wallet of your choice you can use them like any other bitcoins.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Does playing Hash Hunt use up a lot of data?</b></br>
    A: No. Hash Hunt only uses a small amount of data when (1) when you load the page, (2) when a new round starts, (3) when
    you submit a winning pattern to the Hash Hunt server. Playing Hash Hunt for several hours uses less data than loading the
    New York Times homepage once - and is far more productive.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Is there a time limit to claim my bitcoins if I win?</b><br>
    A: No. You can take as long as you want to import your winnings into your wallet. The only ways you can forfeit your winnings
    are if (1) you lose your redemption code, or (2) you share your redemption code with someone and they use it to claim your bitcoins
    before you do. It is strongly recommend that you immediately record your redemption code in a safe place and do not share
    it with anyone.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Is there a limit to how often I can win a prize?</b><br>
    A: No. First to solve the puzzle in each round always wins the prize. There are no restrictions on how often or how many times you can win.
</p>

<p><b>Q: How do I solve the puzzle?</b><br>
    A: Find the pattern of selected numbers that makes all of the wheels land on hashes.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Are there any partial paylines?</b><br>
    A: Possibly coming soon, but for now Hash Hunt only pays full jackpots.
</p>

<p><b>Q: It says that I solved the puzzle, but not all of the wheels are hashes. Is this a bug?</b><br>
    A: There are rare cases when you can come very, very close to getting all of the hashes and the system will
    give you the benefit of the doubt and consider the puzzle solved even though there still is one wheel that
    is not a hash. These are real wins and you will receive the prize (assuming you are the first in that round).
</p>

<p><b>Q: I solved the puzzle but now it turns out that I am not the winner and do not get a prize?</b><br>
    A: To receive a prize, you must be the *first* to solve the puzzle in a given round. Rarely, two solutions will be
    found at almost the same time (usually seconds apart) and it will take a few minutes to determine which is the true winner.
    When you solve a puzzle, you will automatically be taken to a link where you can check the status of the round to see
    if you were the first to solve the puzzle.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Can I play Hash Hunt offline (like on an airplane or in a subway)?</b><br>
    A: You can play anywhere, but to win a prize you must be the first to submit your solution to the network- which
    requires a network connection. Additionally you need a network connection to find out when a new round has started so you
    do not waste time solving an old puzzle.
</p>

<p><b>Q: How many tries do I get to find the correct pattern?</b><br>
    A: You can keep trying different patterns until the round ends, which usually takes several minutes.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Do I have to start over again from scratch when the current round ends?</b><br>
    A: Yes, all puzzles reset at the beginning of each new round. Puzzles also reset anytime you reload the Hash Hunt webpage.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Is this real?</b><br>
    A: This is real. If you are the first to get all of the hashes in a given round then you will win 5 bitcoin.
</p>

<p><b>Q: I have a question.</b><br>
    A: If you have read the above FAQ carefully and still have a question, you can contact me <a href="http://josh.com/contact.html">here</a>a>. Please note that I can not
    give advice on winning strategies - you have to figure it out for yourself!
